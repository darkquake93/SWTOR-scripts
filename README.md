SWTOR-scripts
=============

Enjoy the scripts!

This is where my scripts will go which I make for the Star Wars: The Old Republic game :)

All you need to do is run the exes here which I have converted from the AHK files. Detailed descriptions of my scripts can be found on my website on this page:

The AHK files are here too of course, so you can look through those or convert them to EXE's yourself if you like as I'm new to the site so you may not trust me enough at this point :p

Snowballs
=============

Use Snowballs script when you're just the right distance between your
companion to use the throw snowball ability, and targetting them. Make sure to
run this a little while till you get your first Snow Parcel, then drag the
window down so the Accept button is right where the debuff icon is. Windows b
starts the script loop, and Windows n pauses it.

Have fun racking up those parcels! ^^
