SWTOR-scripts
=============

Enjoy the scripts!

This is where my scripts will go which I make for the Star Wars: The Old Republic game :)

All you need to do is run the exes here which I have converted from the AHK files. Detailed descriptions of my scripts can be found on my website on this page:

The AHK files are here too of course, so you can look through those or convert them to EXE's yourself if you like as I'm new to the site so you may not trust me enough at this point :p
